## Getting Started 🚀

The following script handles **everything**:

- 📦 Installing dependencies
- 🔍 Checking your Node version
- 💻 Running the development server
- ⚡ Building for production and previewing your app

Run the script according to your platform:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
bin/dev             # 🏃‍♂️ Run locally
bin/dev --production # 🚀 Build and preview production

# Make sure the script is executable (if not, run this once)
chmod +x bin/dev

# Windows
node bin/dev.js        # 🏃‍♂️ Run locally
node bin/dev.js --production # 🚀 Build and preview production

```

Our project style is built using **[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)** – a lightweight Tailwind CSS component library that makes styling easy and consistent.
